   <p><strong><h1>Q2.</h1></strong> 

All values except from primitive values are objects in javascript. To create an object in 
javascript one has to have knowledge of variables. Variables being the memory storage for 
our values. You need to first declare a variable using the var, let or const keywords.
Then you have to input the equals operator and calibraces ,which will declare the scope 
of your object. Objects are created using key and values and are separated using a comma.
If you would wish to get an output from your objects, you can do so by using the console.log keyword.
You will have to input the variable name and the key you would like to access from the object.
With ES6 that has been made easy. By doing that, you would have sucessfully created an object in Javascript.

   <p><strong><h1>Q3.</h1></strong>
    Global scope − it is has a global scope which means it can be accessed  anywhere in your JavaScript code. <br>

    Local scope − it has a local scope which is only accesible within a function where it is defined. 
    Function parameters are always local to that function. <br>
    
    A lexical scope - it means that a variable defined outside a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. 
  </p>
   <p><strong><h1>Q4.</h1></strong>
    Nothing will output in the console in both of the functions simply because, the first return statement immediately 
    stops execution of our function and causes our function to stop, therefore output can not be seen. The same goes for the second function.
